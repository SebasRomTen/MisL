# MisL
A roblox lua library for helpful things. This is not the final product of it.

Here is the **loader**


```lua
local MisL : "Library" = loadstring(game:GetService("HttpService"):GetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebasRomTen/MisL/main/source.lua"))()
```
This library just work as a roblox default ***module*** so it isn't hard to manipulate or use.
